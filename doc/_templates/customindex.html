        <h2>Open Standard</h2>
        <p>
          Autocrypt is an open specification for e-mail encryption.
          Under the hood, it uses OpenPGP and other e-mail standards.

    <h2>What is Autocrypt? What is its status?</h2>
    <p>
      Autocrypt is a specification which mail application programmers can implement
      to offer their users convenient end-to-end encryption for e-mail. The first specification
      has been released in December 2017 and a few mail programs already have or are heading 
      towards Autocrypt-capable releases in spring 2018.  At this point, we are reaching out 
      to programmers, interested users and researchers to join us in testing and refining 
      the "Level 1" specification which provides the baseline for e-mail encryption.  Feedback and 
      questions are welcome, see the <a href="{{ pathto('contact') }}">Contact Page</a>.
