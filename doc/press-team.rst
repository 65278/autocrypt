Autocrypt Press Team
====================

The Autocrypt Press Team handles mail sent to press-team@autocrypt.org,
which we expect to be about press-related inquiries. This document
describes our practises how we handle and account for
press communications.

Current members
---------------

- Holger Krekel / hpk42

- Vincent Breitmoser / valodim



Quick response times
--------------------

The press team strives to answer within two workdays on inquiries,
and often will get back faster.

Who is responsible for press-team@autocrypt.org
-----------------------------------------------------

Press team members don't need to formally publish their nicks
or names (though they can), but they are not considered a secret.
Providing legal names is not required. Nicks are sufficient.

Accountability of press-team
-----------------------------------------------------------

The press-team is accountable in the sense that anyone can ask
how media reporting came about and how and who, if anyone, was involved
from the press-team.  Note that often journalists do not ask back before
they publish articles, or do not even contact a project.

If you want to be on the team
---------------------------------

If you want to help take responsibility for the press team, ask the
existing press team.  Anyone on the existing press team may
add you if you're an active member of the project.

Usage of press Always reply from your own specific e-mail address
--------------------------------------------------

When replying to an e-mail that was sent to the press-team, members
of the press team reply from their personal e-mail address, so everyone can
tell who is replying to and having the conversation.  They will typically
Cc the press-team at least on the initial reply so that the others know the
communication is handled. If a conversation moved off to phone-calls,
interviews, or private e-mail, press members typically send a brief
summary note to the other team members.  Note that the press-team alias
e-mail address is only for inbound contacts, and shouldn't be used to
send new messages that aren't a reply.


Changing practises
------------------

If you feel this press team document needs updates,
please send PRs with a short rationale.
